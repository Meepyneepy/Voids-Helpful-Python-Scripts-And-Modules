# Void's Helpful Python Modules and Script
This repository was created to host a bunch of scripts I've made to add a bit more function to projects I build in the future. My goal is to create tools that are as light weight as possible, because I can find it a little annoying when I need to download a ton of modules to get something to work. Especially if I am jumping from device to device. 

**Every tool here requires the "utils.py" file to be in the main directory (as of now at least).**
