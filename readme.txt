This repository was created to host a bunch of scripts I've made to add a bit more function to projects I build in the future. My goal is to create tools that are as light weight as possible, because I can find it a little annoying when I need to download a ton of modules to get something to work. Every tool here requires the "utils.py" file to be in the directory (as of now at least).
